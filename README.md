# Svelte photo gallery

It is based on svelte [deferred transitions example](https://svelte.dev/examples#deferred-transitions)

I have added some additional functionality like showing proper images instead of colored squares,
Keyboard events like hitting the escape key to exit the currently selected image, and the arrow
keys to navigate between them.
