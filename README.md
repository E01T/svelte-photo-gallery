# Svelte photo gallery

It is based on svelte [deferred transitions example](https://svelte.dev/examples#deferred-transitions)
I have added additional functionality like proper images instead of coloured squares, keyboard events like 
Esc keystrokes to exit image, Arrow Left and Arrow Right events for easy navigation between images etc.
